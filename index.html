		    <p>This is the paragraph about Craig, and yes I probably be talking about him in the third party becaause it is fun.<br>	Not much to talk about I work as a mechanic all of my life.  At least the part that I do remember. I have been a mechanic/ computer geek all my life, I have been told. Seven years ago I suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Not much to talk about just remember seeing stars. Yes in computer terms I had a format C and had my OS reloaded but many files were lost in the transfer. Now that that part of my bio is over with.<br>
			Now life goes on and I am going to do it better this time. I am going to get a degree/ diploma in computer coding. I have always want to do this since the 6th grade when I was first allowed to really play with computers and basic coding. <br>
			My hobbies are as follows I like computers, building them and playing games on them. Renaissance festivals is my number two hobby, it were I can play with swords. Yes I play with swords and teach other people stage combat. Plus I also make swords so not only do I get to play with swords I made and teach stage combat. Sorry that total geek sentence run on errorâ€¦
